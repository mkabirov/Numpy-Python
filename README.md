# Numpy Python 

42 Group Project with short deadline - only 2 days to complete.

Numpy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, 
along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

In our case we used it to create fun and colorful instagram-like color filters for photo editing.
